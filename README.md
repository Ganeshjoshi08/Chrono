## 🎯 Project Overview


     In today’s fast-paced software development environment, codebases evolve rapidly, teams change frequently, and critical decisions are often made under time constraints. While modern version control systems excel at 
     tracking code changes, they fall short in preserving the context, intent, and reasoning behind those changes. As a result, valuable knowledge is lost over time, leading to repeated mistakes, increased technical debt, 
     and inefficient collaboration.

     Code Chrono is an intelligent development memory platform designed to bridge this gap. It creates a structured, time-based record of a project’s evolution by capturing not only code-level changes but also the decisions, 
     discussions, and thought processes that drive them. By transforming fragmented development activity into a unified, searchable timeline, Code Chrono enables developers and teams to understand how and why a system evolved 
     the way it did.

    Built with an AI-driven architecture, Code Chrono empowers teams to revisit past decisions with clarity, accelerate onboarding, simplify debugging, and maintain long-term project continuity. It does not replace existing 
    developer tools—instead, it complements them by preserving the human context that traditional tools overlook.
